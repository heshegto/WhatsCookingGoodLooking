# Whats Cooking, Good-Looking
This is my project for web-site that will help people to decide what to cook.

I'm tired of trying to figure out what I want to cook and eat. So I want to build a machine that will dictate me what I should eat.

Wish me luck

# Data bases that should be in my project

- Base of users (and food that they have in their houses)
- Base of food (and where buy it with the cheapest price)
- Base of grocery stores (and their food prices)
- Base of recipes (and food stuff that they required)

# Frontend

Mister Julio Codes really helped me with frontend stuff (css and html). Here is his GitHub: https://github.com/bytesoftheweb
